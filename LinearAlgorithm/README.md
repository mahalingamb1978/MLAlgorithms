The program outlined in this project is a Flask-powered web application that harnesses the capabilities of a pre-trained Linear Regression model to forecast housing prices based on a selection of input features, including metrics like bedroom count, bathroom count, total size, and lot size. To initiate the prediction process, the program initially imports a dataset from a CSV file, diligently navigating the dataset by rectifying missing values, and encoding categorical attributes to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, the program employs feature scaling techniques to standardize the dataset before initiating the training of the Linear Regression model. Post-training, the model, along with the utilized feature scaler, is saved using the pickle module, allowing for seamless access and utilization in subsequent sessions.

The crux of the application rests within the Flask web framework, as it establishes an API endpoint ("/predict") which is designed to receive input data consisting of the aforementioned features. Upon receiving this data, the application employs the saved feature scaler to standardize the input data to a uniform scale as seen during the model training. Following this, the Linear Regression model, having been reloaded from the saved file, performs the prediction based on the scaled input features. The resultant predicted housing price, depicted with careful attention to detail (up to two decimal places), is then presented to the user. This robust pipeline facilitates swift and accurate housing price predictions, making the model an asset for those seeking insights into property valuation.
